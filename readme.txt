A lightweight and minimalist WordPress theme for Elementor site builder.

== Description ==

Hello Elementor is a lightweight and minimalist WordPress theme that was built specifically to work seamlessly with the Elementor site builder plugin. The theme is free, open-source, and designed for users who want a flexible, easy-to-use, and customizable website.

The theme's main focus is on providing a solid foundation for users to build their own unique designs using the Elementor drag-and-drop site builder. It is optimized for speed and performance, and its simplicity and flexibility make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced website designers.

The theme supports common WordPress features which can be extended using a child-theme. In addition, there are several ways to add custom styles. It can be done from **Elementor**, using a child-theme, or with an external plugin. To customize the theme further, visit [Elementor developers docs](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/hello-plus/).
